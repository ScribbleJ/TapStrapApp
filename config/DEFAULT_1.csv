# Lines beginning with # are comments.
# Standard comma-separated values file format.  
#
# first value is a binary map of the fingers, from the right-hand perspective.
#
# remaining values are either commands or characters to type.  You can't use both without a comma in-between.
#
#
# commands are listed fully in "actionMap" in TapInputMethodService.kt
# See Also: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent
# Most all of those should work with the KEYCODE_ part removed.
#
# Extra commands:
#  MAPSWITCH,mapname switches to a different named set of csv -- the name goes after the comma.
#  CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, META, CAPSLOCK, NUMLOCK, SCROLLOCK = Toggle the respective key
#  CTRLONCE, ALTONCE, SHIFTONCE, METAONCE, CAPSLOCKONCE, NUMLOCKONCE, SCROLLOCKONCE = turn the key on for the next key(s) only
#  BACKSPACE, DELETE = for convenience, in the Android KeyCodes these are named DEL and FORWARD_DEL respectively.
